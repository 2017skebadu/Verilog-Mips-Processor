# Verilog-Mips-Processor

This is a 32-bit single core microprocessor based on the MIPS architecture. I have created this microprocessor before in my Computer Architecture class, but that was written in VHDL, so as I am learning Verilog I want to get some good practice that can also show my progress. This also is an oppertunity for me to practice proper coding and documentation, and will serve as my one main personal project until completed to a level I feel sufficient. This time when implimenting the architecture, I'll eventually want to include pipeline shortcuts for hazards, and introduce memory native to the FPGA for instructions. 

## Getting Started

Feel free to download this project and look through it as you'd like. I am using the Vivado Design Suite since its free as a student. I plan to write as much of the code manually as possible, but I may end up using Block Design for some parts, so that may not interpret well depending on if you use another editor. 

### Prerequisites
To test the code yourself, all you need is:

* Xilinx Vivado 2019.2 or later
* Xilinx Basys 3 Development board - for hardware testing
